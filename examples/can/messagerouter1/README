[2 Buses, 1 CAN Message Router]

* Constructure of Network

There are 2 CAN Buses. The sender node 1 and the receiver node 1 are
connected to CAN bus 1. The sender node 2 and the receiver node 2 are
connected to CAN bus 2. The CAN message router is located between CAN
bus 1 and CAN bus 2.

* Behavior

The sender node 1 and the sender node 2 send CAN messages which are
specified in bus.xml periodically.  The receiver nodes receive only
CAN messages to be handled through message filtering.  The sender node
1 can send a message to receiver node 2 through the CAN message
router.
